# practice2048
2048 in Python, Rust, C, C++, TypeScript and Java. Practicing programming languages.

Two different implementations:
* Everything At Once (EAO), where each move happens in one step, like in https://github.com/Armadillan/TensorFlow2048.
* Compress-Merge-Compress, where each move is made up of moving cells as far as they go, merging neighbours of the same value, and moving again. Now with rotation!

All implementations should:
* Be playable with a cosnole frontnend
* Optionally with a GUI frontent
* Track score
* Stop the game on gameover and give the option to restart
